copy:
  hook: "Follow the continent’s tectonic heartbeat."
  short: "The East African Rift splits plates, lifts volcanoes, and creates life-giving lakes. Walk the Rift’s north-to-south panels to see how Afar’s triple junction, the Kenyan dome, and the Malawi graben shape water, soils, and settlements."
  depth:
    - "Cross-sections compare active rifts with dormant segments and associated aquifers."
    - "Profiles highlight geothermal power, obsidian trade, and lake fisheries."
    - "Community case studies show how pastoralists and city planners adapt to seismic risk."
