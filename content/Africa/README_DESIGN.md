# Africa Station Design Overview

## Layout Strategy
- Use sweeping horizontal bands inspired by Sahel sky gradients across the three-column grid.
- Anchor major landform posters with layered relief cutouts for Rift Valley, Sahara, and Congo Basin.
- Maintain 1.25 in gutters; align cultural narratives with biodiversity panels for cross-reference.

## Color & Typography
- Palette: sunbaked ochre (#C47A2C), rainforest emerald (#1F6F4C), coastal cobalt (#20597A).
- Typography: Kaycliff Headline for titles, Kaycliff Serif for body to echo oral storytelling cadence.

## Accessibility
- Raised relief strips follow major transects (Nile, Great Escarpment).
- Audio stations include Swahili, Amharic, Arabic, French, isiZulu narrations.
- Ensure iconography avoids color-only differentiation and respects cultural symbolism.

## Fabrication Notes
- Use breathable acoustic fabric to soften ambient sound from integrated drum soundscapes.
- Incorporate locally sourced bamboo frames for sustainability messaging.
