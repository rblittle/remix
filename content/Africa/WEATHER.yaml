title: "From Harmattan to Cape Storms"
copy:
  hook: "Feel the continent’s seasons sweep from desert dust to coastal rain."
  short: "Trace six signature weather patterns: the West African monsoon, Ethiopian highland rains, Congo rainforest convection, Harmattan dust, Cape Town cold fronts, and Sahelian line storms. An elevation strip follows a Dakar-to-Addis transect to show how altitude steers rainfall."
  depth:
    - "Seasonal arrows reveal when each monsoon cell shifts and why coastal upwelling intensifies."
    - "Dust plume inset explains how Harmattan affects air travel and solar power."
    - "Timeline links El Niño phases to drought planning and pastoral mobility."
