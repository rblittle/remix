# Asia Station Design Overview

## Layout Strategy
- Use sweeping diagonal bands echoing monsoon wind paths across the three-column grid.
- Anchor Himalayan content with a raised central ridge that guides visitors toward island arc stories.
- Pair cultural and innovation posters opposite biodiversity panels for cross-referencing community voices.

## Color & Typography
- Palette: glacier blue (#7DB5D1), monsoon jade (#1F7A5C), volcanic ember (#E0643A).
- Typography: Kaycliff Headline for titles, Kaycliff Sans for body copy to support multilingual typesetting.

## Accessibility
- Provide tactile transects for the Mumbaiâ€“Lhasa elevation strip and Himalayan ridgelines.
- Offer audio narration in Mandarin, Hindi, Bahasa Indonesia, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Tagalog.
- Ensure icon sets combine texture, shape, and color to distinguish phenomena.

## Fabrication Notes
- Integrate edge lighting along migration paths to emphasize movement.
- Use moisture-resistant laminates on weather panels to withstand interactive mist effects.
