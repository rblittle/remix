    text: "The prayer flags whisper louder when katpa winds spill off the ridge, so I cover the solar loom batteries before the dust arrives. Morning light on Stok Kangri tells me how much snow fell; bright blue means enough meltwater for the dye pots. By dusk I log the microgrid output and send the reading to Leh."

    text: "At dawn I tap the log drum in the pattern our elders taught—fast beats call neighbors to weed the millet, slow beats warn of mist that slicks the terraces. My school tablet glows with rainfall charts we collect, so after classes I compare them to the moth swarms around the bamboo torches."
