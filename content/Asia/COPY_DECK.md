  - Animated arrows show altitude gains and wind assistance for geese and falcons.
  - Timeline tracks saiga calving grounds recovering after community-led patrols.
  - Citizen science callouts highlight fisher logbooks and school tagging projects.

## Asia_FEATANIM — Snow Leopard, Shadow of the Highlands
- Hook: Silent paws tread the roof of Asia.
- Short: Snow leopards patrol the cliffs of the Pamir, Tian Shan, and Himalaya. At night they share space with yak herders, community rangers, and camera traps that protect both livestock and rare cats.
- Depth:
  - Life cycle storyboard follows cub rearing, dispersal, and territory marking.
  - Anatomy callouts explain wide nasal cavities, camouflaged fur, and balancing tails.
  - Coexistence panel highlights predator-proof corrals, insurance funds, and youth snow tracking clubs.

## Asia_TREASBIO — Guardians of Genetic Treasures
- Hook: Seeds, breeds, and reefs safeguarded across Asia.
- Short: Journey from the Svalbard-linked seed vault in Yakutsk to Ifugao rice terraces, Bhutan’s cordyceps nurseries, and community-run giant clam hatcheries in Palau. These guardians blend tradition with science to keep food, medicine, and culture thriving.
- Depth:
  - Network map connects seed banks, livestock gene centers, and marine nurseries.
  - Profiles highlight women-led cooperatives, monastic pharmacists, and youth reef rangers.
  - Timeline shows how stored varieties revived harvests after drought and storms.

## Asia_ETHNO — Listening to Monsoon, Steppe, and Tide
- Hook: Four knowledge keepers share land-and-sky cues.
- Short: Meet Ainu salmon stewards in Hokkaido, Khasi cloud readers in Meghalaya, Kazakh eagle hunters in the Altai, and Sama-Bajau navigators in the Sulu Sea. Their observations guide fisheries, forests, and migrations.
- Depth:
  - Map links cultural territories with seasonal calendars and landforms.
  - Quote bands feature Indigenous languages alongside English and national lingua francas.
  - Collaboration panel shows co-designed climate monitoring and education exchanges.
