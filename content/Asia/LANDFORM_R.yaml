  hook: "Volcano arcs knit sea and soil."
  short: "Explore Indonesia, the Philippines, and Japan where subduction builds volcanic chains and rich marine shelves. Lava, ash, and coral growth co-create fertile land yet pose quake and tsunami risks. Communities weave traditional stilt homes with modern sensors."
  depth:
    - "Process diagrams trace subduction, magma chambers, and reef uplift."
    - "Comparative panels show rice terraces, mangrove buffers, and lava fields."
    - "Community stories spotlight Minangkabau builders, Filipino fisherfolk, and Japanese disaster volunteers."
