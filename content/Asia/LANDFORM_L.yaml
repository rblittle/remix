title: "Himalayan Water Towers"
copy:
  hook: "Where ice feeds billions downstream."
  short: "Follow the Himalayan arc from the Pamir Knot to the Eastern Himalaya. Glaciers, debris-covered tongues, and monsoon-fed snowfields store water that flows into the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Mekong, and Yangtze. Communities engineer terraces and warning systems to live with this vertical reservoir."
  depth:
    - "Cross-sections compare high, middle, and lower valley profiles with sediment loads."
    - "Icons show glacial lake outburst paths and mitigation dams."
    - "Case studies feature Sherpa engineers, Ladakhi farmers, and Bhutanese foresters."
