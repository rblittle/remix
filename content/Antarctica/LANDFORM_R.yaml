  hook: "Discover the rock and wind beneath the ice."
  short: "Explore McMurdo Dry Valleys’ permafrost polygons, Antarctic Peninsula nunataks, and iceberg calving fronts in the Weddell S
ea. Scientists, artists, and Antarctic Treaty stewards document microclimates, lichens, and tabular berg drifts to guide protectio
n plans."

    - "Comparative sections show cold desert soils, nunatak habitats, and calving face stratigraphy."
    - "Surface processes panels track katabatic scouring, sublimation, and tide-driven berg rollovers."
    - "Profiles spotlight Antarctic artists-in-residence, Chilean climate rangers, and Sámi guest researchers advising permafrost ca
re."
