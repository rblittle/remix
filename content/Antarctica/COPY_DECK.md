## Antarctica_ANIMCOLL — Polar Highways of Wing, Fin, and Fur
- Hook: Follow globe-spanning migrations that hinge on Antarctic ice.
- Short: Track humpback whales, Antarctic terns, Weddell seals, and light-mantled albatrosses as they depend on sea-ice edges, upwelling fronts, and protected rookeries. Indigenous navigators, treaty monitors, and citizen scientists keep watch from Patagonia to the Ross Sea.
- Depth:
  - Great-circle maps trace migratory routes with seasonal timing and rest sites.
  - Callouts highlight Indigenous knowledge—from Mapuche whale observers to Māori albatross guardians.
  - Data frames connect threats like krill harvest, plastic drift, and vessel noise with mitigation alliances.

## Antarctica_FEATANIM — Weddell Seals: Engineers of Breathing Holes
- Hook: Listen to the seal songs that keep life under the ice.
- Short: Meet the Weddell seals of the McMurdo Sound fast ice. Their teeth carve breathing holes, their songs map territory, and their presence guides scientists monitoring sea-ice change with guidance from Māori and Inuit advisors on respectful wildlife distance.
- Depth:
  - Habitat map shows breathing holes, telemetry routes, and protected zones.
  - Infographics connect tooth wear, ice thickness, and pup survival with stewardship actions.
  - Profiles spotlight seal monitoring divers, Indigenous knowledge keepers, and acoustic technicians.

## Antarctica_TREASBIO — Polar Biocultural Treasures
- Hook: Safeguarding ice cores, seeds, and stories at the bottom of the world.
- Short: Tour the Allan Hills ice core archive, Antarctic fungal libraries, and Patagonia-to-Antarctica Indigenous knowledge exchanges. Scientists, artists, and elders collaborate to store climate records, resilient microbes, and oral histories in secure, consent-driven repositories.
- Depth:
  - Network maps connect ice core vaults, microbial libraries, and cultural archives across hemispheres.
  - Process diagrams follow collection, sterilization, cultural review, and sharing protocols.
  - Case notes honor Indigenous data sovereignty agreements and climate justice storytelling.

## Antarctica_ETHNO — Polar Knowledge Keepers
- Hook: Listen to elders, artists, and scientists share polar wisdom.
- Short: Hear from Māori cultural navigators, Mapuche climate educators, and Antarctic logistics veterans who interpret sky halos, ice sounds, and aurora alerts. Their practices braid ceremony, satellite feeds, and storytelling to keep expeditions safe and grounded.
- Depth:
  - Story excerpts connect natural cues—sun dogs, sastrugi, and auroras—to decision-making.
