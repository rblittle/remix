copy:
  hook: "Four snapshots of cooperation at the cold edge."
  short: "Each column pairs data and voices on energy, food, climate records, and cultural care that sustain Antarctic research communi
 ties and global knowledge."
  depth:
    - "Wind-solar hybrids keep stations warm without extra diesel."
    - "Hydroponic greenhouses feed crews through polar night."
    - "Ice core labs archive climate records with Indigenous consent protocols."
    - "Wellness networks connect field teams with cultural support circles."
featurettes:
  - title: "Katabatic Wind Microgrids"
    summary: "Princess Elisabeth Station and Scott Base share designs for wind turbines tailored to katabatic gusts. Blades fold in stor
ms, while thermal storage tanks release heat during calm spells. Māori engineers co-design controls that log cultural safety margins
 alongside kilowatt output."

  - title: "Polar Night Greenhouses"
    summary: "Concordia and McMurdo stations operate hydroponic farms lit by LED panels tuned to circadian rhythms. Crew members rotate as
 garden stewards, harvesting greens, herbs, and cultural comfort foods requested by rotating national programs. Waste heat from lab
 equipment keeps roots thawed."

    summary: "A wellness network links field teams with counselors, Elders-in-residence, and family video calls. Quiet rooms in Antarctic
 Peninsula stations display rotating art from Indigenous youth. Monthly talanoa circles reduce isolation and inform safety briefings.
