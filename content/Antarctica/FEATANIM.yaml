title: "Weddell Seals: Engineers of Breathing Holes"
copy:
  hook: "Listen to the seal songs that keep life under the ice."
  short: "Meet the Weddell seals of the McMurdo Sound fast ice. Their teeth carve breathing holes, their songs map territory, and their
 presence guides scientists monitoring sea-ice change with guidance from Māori and Inuit advisors on respectful wildlife distance.
