# Antarctica Station Design Overview

## Layout Strategy
- Arrange posters in concentric arcs radiating from a central ice-core sculpture, echoing katabatic wind flow from the pole.
- Position weather and landform panels near chilled touch tables where visitors can feel ice textures and wind tunnels.
- Cluster cultural, innovation, and narrative posters within a warm-light alcove featuring aurora ceiling projections and listening nooks.

## Color & Typography
- Palette: polar midnight blue (#0B1D3A), glacier cyan (#5EC9E0), aurora violet (#8F6FE2), volcanic pumice gray (#B7BBC2), and warm basecamp amber (#FFB25A).
- Typography: Kaycliff Headline for titles, Kaycliff Sans for body copy with extended Latin and Polynesian glyph support; data tables in Kaycliff Mono.

## Accessibility
- Provide tactile ice core cross-sections, raised-route maps, and fabric samples of insulating layers.
- Offer audio narration in English, Spanish, Mapudungun, te reo MƒÅori, and Mandarin with caption displays at multiple heights.
- Maintain non-slip flooring with embedded LEDs guiding low-light navigation; ensure all data visuals use color-plus-pattern encoding.

## Fabrication Notes
- Use aluminum honeycomb panels with low-temperature laminates to resist condensation near chilled exhibits.
- Integrate hidden HVAC vents to prevent frost buildup on graphics while preserving ambient coolness.
- Install modular power/data raceways allowing seasonal science updates and community acknowledgments to be refreshed without reprinting.
