title: "Designing Futures on the Frozen Frontier"
copy:
  hook: "Innovation thrives when culture and science move together."
  short: "Discover Antarctic-led innovations: Chilean-M훮ori joint search-and-rescue drones, Antarctic Peninsula biodegradable field gear
, waste-heat community pods, and ice-forecast AI co-designed with Indigenous knowledge holders. Each project keeps the continent co
mmons-centered."
  depth:
    - "Process maps show consent, prototyping, field testing, and treaty reporting checkpoints."
    - "Funding panels compare treaty cost-sharing, community grants, and circular economy pilots."
    - "QR codes link to open-source manuals translated into Spanish, English, te reo M훮ori, and Inuktitut."
