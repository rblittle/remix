  hook: "Three voices keep the ice, stars, and people in balance."
  short: "A Mapuche elder, a Māori engineer, and a Chilean teen researcher share how they care for Antarctic crews, wildlife, and clima
te records across vast distances."
  depth:
    - "Audio in Mapudungun, te reo Māori, and Spanish with English captions."
    - "Tactile objects—kultrún drum rim, braided cable sheath, and ice core slice—anchor each vignette."
    - "Prompt cards invite visitors to record climate care commitments."

    gender: "female"
    age: 68
    location: "Temuco, Chile"
    text: "When the frost paints our window thick, I drum the kultrún four beats to open the bridge south. The researchers call me on s
 hortwave before sailing, and I remind them to greet the wenu mapu—the sky realm—so storms will listen. I send herbs and recorded la
ullabies with their cargo; the scent keeps homesickness soft when the aurora is loud."
    ai_prompt: "Photo-real portrait of Mapuche elder playing kultrún drum beside radio set with frost on window"
  - name: "Tāne Whaitiri"
    identity: "Māori renewable engineer at Scott Base"
    gender: "male"
    age: 39
    location: "Ross Island, Antarctica"
    text: "Before I spin up the wind turbines, I trace their nacelles with kōwhaiwhai chalk so the blades remember the whakapapa of wind.
 We log each gust in the control hut, then I FaceTime my kids to show them the ice halo. At night I join the Mapuche circle online to r
eport the turbines are humming steady, and we close with karakia for the seals nearby."

    identity: "Chilean teen remote researcher and greenhouse tender"
    gender: "female"
    age: 15
    location: "Punta Arenas, Chile"
    text: "My science class partners with McMurdo’s greenhouse. Each week I test our twin hydroponic bed and compare data with the Antar
ctic crew on video. I label the plants in Spanish, English, and Mapudungun so visiting kids see their languages. After homework I edit a
 podcast episode, inviting polar workers to teach us how they shake off isolation."
