title: "Ice Shelves, Crevasse Fields, and Subglacial Rivers"
copy:
  hook: "Peer beneath the ice to see water sculpting frozen land."
  short: "Follow outlet glaciers from Dome A through crevasse fields into floating ice shelves above hidden rivers. Scientists and polar workers map melt channels, stabilize drill pads, and use autonomous robots guided by Indigenous Māori advisors’ guardianship principles to respect the ice."
  depth:
    - "Cutaway diagrams compare grounded ice, basal melt channels, and subglacial lakes."
    - "Hazard overlays show crevasse densities, blue-ice runway zones, and safe traverse routes."
    - "Profiles highlight field camps, Weddell Sea seal monitors, and Māori cultural exchanges guiding research protocols."
