title: "Katabatic Winds, Polar Vortices, and Sea-Ice Rhythms"
copy:
  hook: "Feel the forces that chill the globe."
  short: "Six dominant phenomena define Antarctic weather: katabatic slope winds, polar vortex circulation, Antarctic Circumpolar Curre
nt storms, polynya heat pumps, atmospheric rivers, and ozone-season sunlight shifts. A transect from Dome C to the Weddell Sea exp
lains how elevation, sea ice, and atmosphere intertwine."
  depth:
    - "Clarify why katabatic winds accelerate off the plateau and how they power coastal polynyas."
    - "Compare when atmospheric rivers bring rare snowfall versus when polar vortex strengthening locks in cold."
    - "Show so what: sea-ice production, global albedo, and research station logistics tied to forecasts."
