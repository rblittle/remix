copy:
  hook: "Life thrives where light, ice, and patience meet."
  short: "Compare three Antarctic biomes: Southern Ocean krill swarms, coastal moss oases, and emperor penguin sea-ice nurseries. Each
 panel pairs keystone species with scientists, Indigenous partners, and policy advocates safeguarding food webs and habitat refuges.
