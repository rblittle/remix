copy:
  hook: "See how water carves coral rims and red sand basins."
  short: "Contrast three signature landforms: Micronesian atolls building vertical coral walls, Melanesian mangrove labyrinths trap
ping sediment, and Australiaâ€™s arid basins sculpted by wind and ephemeral floods. Guardians weave reef gardening, mangrove repla
nting, and desert songline mapping to sustain place."
  depth:
    - "Comparative diagrams show reef flat, lagoon, and ocean slope habitats alongside mangrove zonation and dune swale profiles."
    - "Water stories trace freshwater lenses, blue carbon sinks, and artesian bores with stewardship practices."
    - "Spotlights feature Kiribati fishers, Solomon mud crab farmers, and Martu desert trackers."
