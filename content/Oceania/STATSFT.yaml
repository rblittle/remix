  hook: "Four fast facts powered by saltwater wisdom."
  short: "Each column pairs data and voices on energy, food, water, and cultural pathways connecting Oceania’s islands and coastlines."
  depth:
    - "Floating solar-canoe hybrids electrify remote clinics."
    - "Seagrass meadows feed dugong herds and lock blue carbon."
    - "Rain tank federations share drought insurance across atolls."
    - "Cultural express routes link language nests and maker spaces."
featurettes:
  - title: "Blue Horizon Microgrids"
    summary: "Tuvalu, Tokelau, and outer Cook Islands co-design microgrids that mount solar arrays on double-hulled canoes moored i
n lagoons. Community skippers adjust panels with tides while technicians weave pandanus shelters to protect batteries from salt sp
ray. Clinics and radio towers gain reliable power, and youth navigate maintenance shifts as part of seamanship training."

  - title: "Seagrass Stewardship Guilds"
    summary: "Torres Strait Islanders and New Caledonian Kanak fishers map seagrass meadows using drones, snorkel transects, and i
ntergenerational storytelling. Guardians rotate seasonal closures to feed dugong herds while tallying carbon storage credits that f
und language immersion camps. Kids learn to read tidal cues and drone imagery in the same lesson, turning data into cultural songs."

  - title: "Atoll Rain Tank Federations"
    summary: "Women-led cooperatives across Kiribati and the Marshall Islands link hundreds of household rain tanks via smart gaug
es. Radio nets announce when tanks reach low thresholds, triggering inter-island water barge rotations. Cooperative dues build a r
apid repair fund, and every installation opens with songs blessing the freshwater lens beneath."

    summary: "A network of community centers from Honolulu to Rapa Nui pairs language nests, maker labs, and digital canoe simulator
s. Traveling teachers deliver workshops via hybrid sail-cargo vessels, sharing immersive lessons on star chants, coding, and fiber
 arts. Visitors log pledges to learn phrases before boarding, turning ferries into floating classrooms."
