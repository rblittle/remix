- Depth:
  - Flowlines chart migration directions, seasonal timing, and culturally significant waypoints.
  - Callouts highlight Indigenous monitoring—from Tongan whale songs to Micronesian turtle tagging nights.
  - Data frames connect habitat threats, plastic interception booms, and sanctuary expansions.

## Oceania_FEATANIM — Kākāpō: Night Parrots of Whenua Hou
- Hook: Step quietly into a nocturnal forest comeback.
- Short: Meet the kākāpō—flightless parrots rebounding on Whenua Hou and Anchor Island. Ngāi Tahu kaitiaki partner with scientists, scent-tracking dogs, and remote feeders to boost chicks, control disease, and safeguard genetic diversity.
- Depth:
  - Habitat map shows predator-free islands, translocation flights, and offshore sanctuary zones.
  - Infographics connect supplementary feeding, health screenings, and whānau-led monitoring.
  - Profiles spotlight Māori cultural protocols, volunteer whānau whānui, and biosecurity crews.

## Oceania_TREASBIO — Oceanic Biocultural Treasures
- Hook: Guardians keep seeds, spores, and reef genomes alive.
- Short: Explore the Fijian Sawaieke breadfruit archive, Samoa’s coral cryobank, and Arnhem Land yam libraries. Each treasure is co-managed by elders, scientists, and youth who braid protocols, freezer tech, and floating nurseries to secure future harvests.
- Depth:
  - Map connections between seed vaults, coral nurseries, and knowledge exchanges across island chains.
  - Process diagrams follow collection, ceremony, storage, and sharing steps.
  - Case notes honor cultural permissions, reciprocal agreements, and climate-ready crop trials.

## Oceania_ETHNO — Navigators, Fire Keepers, and Tide Interpreters
- Hook: Hear how stories forecast sky, soil, and sea.
