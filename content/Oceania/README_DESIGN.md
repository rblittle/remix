# Oceania Station Design Overview

## Layout Strategy
- Arrange posters in a sweeping arc echoing a voyaging canoe, with the centerpiece map anchoring the midpoint and migration ribbon graphics guiding visitors clockwise.
- Pair weather and landform panels near tactile bathymetry tables so guests can trace elevation and ocean depth simultaneously.
- Cluster cultural, innovation, and narrative posters beside listening alcoves that diffuse wave audio and provide seating for reflection.

## Color & Typography
- Palette: deep ocean indigo (#1F3B6D), reef coral (#FF7A5C), mangrove green (#1F6F5B), desert ochre (#C76E2B), and starlight cream (#F2E9D8).
- Typography: Kaycliff Headline for titles, Kaycliff Sans for body copy with Polynesian diacritics support; numerals set in Kaycliff Mono for data overlays.

## Accessibility
- Provide tactile relief tiles for key maps, including raised voyaging routes and mangrove root textures.
- Offer audio narration in English, Bislama, Tok Pisin, Samoan, te reo MƒÅori, and Hawaiian, with captioned transcripts at eye level.
- Maintain 4.5:1 contrast on all data panels and ensure route arrows combine color with patterned strokes.

## Fabrication Notes
- Use marine-grade plywood with coconut-husk veneer for panel edges to resist humidity.
- Integrate concealed LED edge lighting that mimics star paths without glare on glossy map surfaces.
- Mount posters on adjustable rails to accommodate seasonal updates, treaty acknowledgments, and community-requested revisions.
