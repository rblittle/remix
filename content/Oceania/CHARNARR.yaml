  - name: "Dilong Sengebau"
    identity: "Palauan master navigator and canoe carpenter"
    gender: "male"
    age: 57
    location: "Ngarchelong, Palau"
    text: "When the swell from the northeast beats three heartbeats faster than the southern swell, I know the reef pass is clearing. I
 set my students to tapping the etak sticks while I align the canoe bow with the star Dilang. Before we launch, I radio the weather
 office, then switch it off so we can listen for flying fish skipping—a sign the current favors us."

    location: "Munda, Solomon Islands"
    text: "I wade to my knees before class to check the crab pots and the drone battery. The mangrove seedlings we plant with Year 8 stude
nts follow the moon, so I sing the planting song while logging salinity on the tablet. After school the aunties join us to weave nee
dle mats that mark no-cut zones, and we stream the data to cousins upriver."

    text: "My tutu lets me bike the shoreline before sunrise if I stop to feel the sluice gate stones. Their warmth tells me how long the
 tide has rested. I patch the AI sensor code on my phone, then scan the limu beds for the first ʻamaʻama flashes. At school I stream t
he pond readings into our language app so classmates can learn Hawaiian words for each change."
