title: "Ocean Migrations, Island Stopovers"
copy:
  hook: "Trace fin, feather, and flipper across the Pacific."
  short: "Follow humpback whales, green turtles, bar-tailed godwits, and flying foxes as they navigate currents, stars, and communit

  depth:
    - "Flowlines chart migration directions, seasonal timing, and culturally significant waypoints."
    - "Callouts highlight Indigenous monitoring—from Tongan whale songs to Micronesian turtle tagging nights."
    - "Data frames connect habitat threats, plastic interception booms, and sanctuary expansions."
