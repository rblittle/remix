title: "Trade Winds, Monsoon Pulses, and Cyclone Guardians"
copy:
  hook: "Feel how ocean and sky choreograph island seasons."
  short: "Six headline systems shape Oceania: Pacific trade winds, El Niño–Southern Oscillation swings, Australian monsoon surges,
 tropical cyclones, southern ocean westerlies, and highland cloud forests. A transect from Arnhem Land to the Southern Alps revea
ls how elevation steers rainfall and cultural readiness."
  depth:
    - "Explain why shifting sea-surface temperatures amplify or calm cyclone risk across Melanesia and Polynesia."
    - "Show when monsoon bursts, trade-wind droughts, and westerly fronts peak, with community adaptation stories."
    - "Highlight so what: freshwater security, reef stress, and fire regimes tied to atmospheric rivers and ENSO outlooks."
