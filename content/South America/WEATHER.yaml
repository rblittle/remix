title: "Atmospheric Rivers, Monsoons, and Ice Winds"
copy:
  hook: "Feel how sky rivers shape rainforest and pampas."
  short: "Six systems anchor this panel: Amazon sky rivers, Altiplano hailstorms, ENSO-driven droughts, Atlantic trade winds, Patagonia’s westerlies, and the South Atlantic Convergence Zone. A transect from Lima over the Andes to Belém reveals how altitude redistributes moisture."
  depth:
    - "Explain how evapotranspiration feeds atmospheric rivers that deliver rain to distant farms."
    - "Show seasonal contrasts between wet/dry Amazonia and double rainy seasons in the southeast."
    - "Community vignettes highlight shipibo farmers, Bolivian llama herders, and gauchos adapting forecasts."
