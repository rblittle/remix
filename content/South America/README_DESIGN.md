# South America Station Design Overview

## Layout Strategy
- Arrange posters in a sweeping arc that mirrors the Andes-to-Amazon flow, guiding visitors from highlands to coasts.
- Anchor the centerpiece map beside an interactive atmospheric river projection and surround with biome, culture, and innovation panels.
- Use braided connective graphics to link weather, landform, and community stories across the sequence.

## Color & Typography
- Palette: canopy green (#2F7D4C), river teal (#1E8CA3), volcanic copper (#C4562E), glacier mist (#CFE3E7).
- Typography: Kaycliff Headline for titles, Kaycliff Sans for body copy with extended Latin and Indigenous diacritics.

## Accessibility
- Provide tactile elevation strips, flood cycle wheels, and seed samples with braille identifiers.
- Offer audio narration in Spanish, Portuguese, Quechua, Guarani, Ash√°ninka, and Mapudungun.
- Ensure floor cues use high-contrast patterns and non-slip materials for humid environments.

## Fabrication Notes
- Integrate sustainably harvested bamboo frames and recycled aluminum mounts for humid climates.
- Seal interactive elements to resist condensation from nearby mist and plant installations.
- Design modular caption plates so treaty and data updates can be swapped without full reprints.
