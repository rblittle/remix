    age: 34
    location: "Rio Ene, Peru"
    text: "Before dawn I grind urucum to paint weather symbols on our canoe; the color reminds listeners which clouds ride in. I launch the solar radio to announce river levels, then carry seed packets upriver, steering by the smell of flowering guava. When the macaws cry at noon, I schedule our next community planting."

    age: 16
    location: "Temuco, Chile"
    text: "My grandfather shows me how canelo leaves twist before rain, so I launch the mapping drone to scan the reforested hillside. I tag each araucaria sapling in Mapudungun and Spanish, then upload the data to our community server before evening drumming."
    ai_prompt: "Photo-real image of Mapuche teen operating small drone over araucaria saplings with elder nearby"

    text: "The tide drum echoes through our stilt houses at first light, so I wade in to check oyster baskets. If the water tastes sweet, I invite neighbors for a caldo share and send a voice note to the school to bring buckets. When thunder rolls inland, we tighten the mangrove root bridges before the evening feast."
