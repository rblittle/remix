  - Community highlights feature Quechua condor monitors, Tikuna turtle guardians, and Pantanal jaguar ecotourism guides.
  - QR-linked audio shares wingbeats, river sounds, and traditional songs.

## SouthAmerica_FEATANIM — Hyacinth Macaw Neighbors
- Hook: Hear cobalt wings beating over flooded forests.
- Short: Hyacinth macaws rely on palm groves in the Pantanal and Cerrado. Indigenous, rancher, and scientist partners protect nest cavities, manage fire, and grow native palms so these brilliant birds keep soaring.
- Depth:
  - Nest map shows protected cavities, ranch agreements, and firebreak mosaics.
  - Infographic links palm fruit harvest, clay lick minerals, and chick survival.
  - Profiles feature Guató canoe rangers, women-led nest guardians, and veterinary teams.

## SouthAmerica_TREASBIO — Seed Houses, Clay Banks, and Living Pharmacies
- Hook: Safeguard the genetic gifts of rainforest and Andes.
- Short: Explore Kichwa chakra seed houses in Ecuador, quilombola medicinal gardens in Brazil, and Yanomami mushroom libraries. These community networks conserve crops, medicines, and fungi essential for resilience.
- Depth:
  - Map shows seed-sharing routes, canoe deliveries, and cloud forest trails.
  - Infographic details storage—from clay pots to solar-dehydrated sachets.
  - Case notes describe governance protocols rooted in traditional law.

## SouthAmerica_ETHNO — Reading Rain, Stars, and Flood Pulse
- Hook: Forecasts shaped by song, smoke, and tide.
- Short: Hear how Wayuu, Kichwa, and Quilombola knowledge keepers interpret clouds, constellations, and mangrove tides to plan planting, fishing, and celebrations. Their teachings complement satellite forecasts to protect communities.
- Depth:
  - Story panels pair traditional cues with meteorological explanations.
  - Calendars show ritual cycles aligned with rainy, dry, and tidal seasons.
