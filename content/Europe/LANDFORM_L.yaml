copy:
  hook: "Ice carved steps, people built harbors."
  short: "Explore Scandinavia’s fjords, Finland’s lake labyrinth, and Iceland’s volcanic icefields. Glacial scouring, isostatic rebound, and geothermal uplift shape fisheries, forests, and energy systems across the European north."
  depth:
    - "Cross-sections compare U-shaped valleys, drumlin fields, and volcanic rift zones."
    - "Process diagrams show isostatic rebound raising shorelines."
    - "Community features highlight Sami reindeer herders, Icelandic geothermal engineers, and Finnish lakehouse stewards."
