narratives:
  - name: "Elle-Rávná"
    identity: "Sámi reindeer herder and joik singer"
    gender: "female"
    age: 42
    location: "Kautokeino Plateau, Norway"
    text: "When the snow crystals clink like tiny glass beads, I know the crust will hold the herd and we can travel without injuring their hooves. I press my palm to the birch bark; if sap starts tasting sweet, calving time is near. I hum the joik of this valley so the calves learn the safe river crossing."
    ai_prompt: "Photo-real portrait of Sámi woman in gákti clothing touching birch tree beside reindeer under northern light"
  - name: "Milan"
    identity: "Dutch polder student engineer"
    gender: "male"
    age: 14
    location: "Almere, Netherlands"
    text: "Before school I bike the dike and listen for the turbine blades—slow whoosh means north wind and the floating classroom will tilt a bit. I scan the canal gauge; if it dips below the green marker, our team messages the water board to ease the pumps. After class we test our flood sensors on the playground bridge."
    ai_prompt: "Photo-real image of Dutch teenage boy on bike checking water gauge near turbines and floating classroom"
  - name: "Lucia"
    identity: "Sicilian terraced citrus grower"
    gender: "female"
    age: 63
    location: "Valle dei Templi, Italy"
    text: "At dawn the air smells of fennel and sea salt; that means the scirocco is gentle enough to shake the irrigation ropes loose. I rest my hand on the stone terrace—if it still holds night’s cool, the oranges will keep their shine. My grandson notes the cistern level while I whistle the pruning rhythm my mother taught me."
