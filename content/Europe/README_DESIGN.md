# Europe Station Design Overview

## Layout Strategy
- Organize posters along a sweeping coastline motif that begins in the Arctic north wall and flows to Mediterranean themes.
- Use interlocking polygons inspired by European town plazas to align maps, graphs, and narratives.
- Pair landform and weather panels opposite cultural and innovation stories for cross-navigation.

## Color & Typography
- Palette: fjord teal (#1F5C6D), alpine gold (#D7A441), terracotta (#C96B4D).
- Typography: Kaycliff Headline for titles, Kaycliff Serif for body to echo multilingual print traditions.

## Accessibility
- Provide tactile coastline strips and braille overlays on key maps.
- Offer audio tours in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, and Greek with easy-scan QR codes.
- Apply patterned backgrounds behind data to avoid color-only differentiation.

## Fabrication Notes
- Incorporate backlit acrylic behind North Sea and Mediterranean maps to mimic maritime glow.
- Use sustainable cork panels for tactile elements referencing dehesa and vineyard themes.
