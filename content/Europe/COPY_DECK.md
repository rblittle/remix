## Europe_FEATANIM — Iberian Lynx: Keeper of the Dehesa
- Hook: Spotted shadows protect Mediterranean woodlands.
- Short: Iberian lynx roam cork oak dehesa landscapes, relying on rabbit-rich mosaics maintained by ranchers and fire brigades. Community nurseries raise rabbit populations while wildlife crossings reconnect fragmented habitat.
- Depth:
  - Life cycle storyboard follows kittens from den to dispersal corridors.
  - Anatomy panel explains ear tufts, whisker pads, and silent paw fur.
  - Stewardship section showcases rancher agreements, road underpasses, and youth tracking teams.

## Europe_TREASBIO — Custodians of Seed, Cheese, and Coast
- Hook: Heritage foods and species safeguarded for tomorrow.
- Short: Visit Norway’s Svalbard Global Seed Vault partnerships, Italy’s Parmigiano Reggiano microbial libraries, Spain’s chestnut cooperatives, and Portugal’s seagrass nurseries. Networks of farmers, scientists, and fishers protect genetic diversity essential to resilient diets and economies.
- Depth:
  - Network map links seed banks, microbial labs, orchards, and seagrass plots.
  - Profiles highlight intergenerational cooperatives and apprenticeships.
  - Timeline shows how stored seeds and cultures revived harvests after blight and heatwaves.

## Europe_ETHNO — Listening to Fjord, Plain, and Sea
- Hook: Four knowledge keepers share their cues.
- Short: Hear from Sámi reindeer herders in Norway, Basque inshore fishers, Hungarian puszta herdswomen, and Greek island sponge divers. Their observations of snow, swell, grass, and currents guide community decisions.
- Depth:
  - Map links cultural territories with seasonal calendars and landforms.
  - Quotes appear in Northern Sámi, Euskara, Hungarian, and Greek alongside English translations.
  - Collaboration panel shows joint climate adaptation and heritage preservation projects.
