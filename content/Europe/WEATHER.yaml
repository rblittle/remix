  hook: "Feel Atlantic westerlies meet alpine walls."
  short: "Trace six hallmark systems: North Atlantic storm tracks, Mediterranean mistral and bora winds, Alpine foehn flows, Arctic polar night cyclones, Baltic lake-effect snow, and continental heat domes. An elevation strip from Lisbon across the Pyrenees and Alps to the Danube Plain shows how relief redirects air masses."
