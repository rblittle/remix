# North America Station Design Overview

## Layout Strategy
- Use sweeping gradients from icy blues to warm bayou greens guiding visitors across the poster sequence.
- Anchor centerpiece map in view of tactile Great Lakes basin model and wrap supplementary posters around interactive migration ribbon.
- Pair weather and landform posters opposite cultural and innovation stories to encourage cross-referencing science and lived experience.

## Color & Typography
- Palette: polar twilight blue (#3B6FA4), prairie gold (#D7A32E), bayou cypress green (#1C6E4A), coral reef accent (#F26D5A).
- Typography: Kaycliff Headline for titles, Kaycliff Sans for body copy with extended Latin support for French and Spanish diacritics.

## Accessibility
- Provide tactile overlays for elevation transects, migration routes, and key watersheds.
- Offer audio narration in English, Spanish, French, and Indigenous languages featured on each poster.
- Ensure path lighting and floor graphics include high-contrast edges and Braille direction arrows.

## Fabrication Notes
- Integrate recycled cedar frames echoing canoe ribs for narrative posters.
- Seal weather panels with marine-grade laminate to resist humidity from nearby misting interactives.
- Use modular mounting rails so treaties and data updates can be swapped without reprinting full panels.
