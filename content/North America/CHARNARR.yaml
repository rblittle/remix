    text: "When the shorefast ice darkens to the color of raven wings, I measure thickness with my grandmother’s ivory tip and log the reading on the satellite tablet. We move the umiaq frames inland if the lead widens, but when the wind carries the scent of kelp I call the crew—it means the seals are following the current edge."

    location: "Chinle, Navajo Nation"
    text: "My job is to walk the sheep before sunrise and text my auntie if I spot new wildflower patches. The yellow rabbitbrush tells us when to start dyeing yarn, and we save the brightest skeins for the solar-powered loom in grandma’s hogan. I track rainfall on my phone so we know which grazing paddock needs a rest."

    location: "Jean Lafitte, Louisiana"
    text: "Before a storm I taste the air for salt and watch the cypress knees—if the water rises fast we gather neighbors for gumbo on the propane stove. My granddaughter and I weave palmetto mats to block the door gaps, then message the parish about elders needing rides. When the egrets settle low, we pack the boat with medical kits and head to check the levee."
