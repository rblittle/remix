title: "Migration Highways Across the Continent"
copy:
  hook: "Trace the journeys of wing, fin, and hoof."
  short: "See how monarch butterflies, caribou, gray whales, and whooping cranes rely on protected stopovers and community science. Pan-continental maps show how urban gardens, Indigenous agreements, and marine sanctuaries keep these migrations intact."
  depth:
    - "Flow arrows track seasonal directions with rest-stop annotations."
    - "Community spotlights feature Monarch Waystation hosts, Inuit hunters sharing whale counts, and Texan crane wardens."
    - "QR-linked soundscapes immerse visitors in wingbeats, surfacing breaths, and hoof thunder."
