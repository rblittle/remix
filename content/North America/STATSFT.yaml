copy:
  hook: "Four fast facts, rooted in community."
  short: "Each column pairs data and voices on energy, food, water, and cultural lifeways that stitch North America together."
  depth:
    - "Arctic microgrids stabilize health clinics through hybrid power."
    - "Prairie bison grazing co-ops rebuild soil and economies."
    - "Borderland wetlands soak storm surges while honoring treaty access."
    - "Urban cooling trails weave shade, transit, and storytelling."
featurettes:
  - title: "Arctic Hybrid Microgrids"
    summary: "In Nunavut and Alaska Native villages, cooperatives blend wind, solar, and diesel-backup with community-owned batteries. Youth apprentices maintain sensors while elders set load priorities, keeping clinics and food freezers powered through polar nights."
