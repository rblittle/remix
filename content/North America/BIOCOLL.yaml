title: "From Boreal Forests to Baja Reefs"
copy:
  hook: "Three biomes, countless caretakers."
  short: "Compare the Boreal forest fire mosaics, Tallgrass prairie seed banks, and Gulf-Caribbean reef corridors. Each panel pairs keystone species with communities restoring balance through cultural burns, seed rematriation, and coral gardening."
  depth:
    - "Climate charts align temperature and precipitation for each biome."
    - "Biodiversity indicators highlight species richness, carbon storage, and reef connectivity."
    - "Stories feature Cree fire crews, Oglala Lakota seed keepers, and Garifuna reef stewards."
