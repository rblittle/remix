- Depth:
  - Animated map traces synchronized migrations with seasonal color cues and stopover icons.
  - Profiles explain navigation tools: magnetic sensing, celestial cues, and memory of river scents.
  - Community science panels highlight Indigenous observers, fishers, and satellite taggers collaborating to protect corridors.

## World_FEATANIM — The Resilient Saiga
- Hook: Meet the antelope with a built-in air filter.
- Short: Saiga antelope once thundered across Eurasian grasslands in millions. Today their unusual noses help them survive dust storms, while guardians coordinate international corridors from Kazakhstan to Mongolia.
- Depth:
  - Lifecycle storyboard shows spring calving aggregations, summer migrations, and winter sheltering.
  - Health panel explains the saiga’s nose structure and how it warms frigid air.
  - Conservation snapshot maps cross-border patrols, vaccination campaigns, and community ranger training.

## World_TREASBIO — Seed Vaults & Living Libraries
- Hook: Protecting tomorrow’s biodiversity today.
- Short: Explore how communities archive life—from Svalbard’s Global Seed Vault to community seed banks in Ethiopia and coral nurseries in the Caribbean. See why genetic diversity is a treasure for food, medicine, and resilience.
- Depth:
  - Map charts global network of seed vaults, botanical gardens, and reef gene banks.
  - Profiles spotlight farmers, scientists, and youth caretakers preserving heirloom varieties.
  - Case timeline shows how stored seeds revived crops after disasters.

## World_ETHNO — Ways of Knowing the Earth
- Hook: Many knowledge systems, one shared planet.
- Short: Hear from navigators, farmers, and storytellers whose traditions read Earth’s signals. Polynesian wayfinders interpret stars and swells, Sámi herders track snow crusts, and Andean agronomists tend potato terraces tuned to microclimates.
- Depth:
  - Quotes in original languages with translations celebrate knowledge keepers.
