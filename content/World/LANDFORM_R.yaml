  hook: "Trace how erosion carves the face of every continent."
  short: "Delve into the processes that shape valleys, dunes, and fjords. Compare glacial chiseling in Patagonia with wind-carved Sahara yardangs and river-built Mekong deltas. Discover how life and communities adapt to these ever-changing edges."
  depth:
    - "Process diagrams show mechanical, chemical, and biological weathering side-by-side."
    - "Case studies map three iconic erosion landscapes with time-lapse imagery."
    - "Callouts link erosion control strategies—from terraced farming to mangrove restoration—to hazard reduction."
