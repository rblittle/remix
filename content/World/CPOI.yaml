title: "Atlas Trail Orientation"
copy:
  hook: "Start your trail with the planet in your hands."
  short: "This centerpiece orients you to how land, water, and people interlace across Earth. Follow the color bands to match continents, biomes, and migration currents. Trace the time ribbon to see how humans have navigated changing climates."
  depth:
    - "Continental silhouettes pair with biome swatches to show how deserts, forests, and tundra cluster by latitude."
    - "Layered migration arrows highlight major journeys from early Homo sapiens dispersals to contemporary urban networks."
    - "An Earth-systems timeline links volcanic pulses, ocean circulation shifts, and technological milestones that reshaped habitats."
