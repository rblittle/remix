title: "Rift to Ridge: Earth’s Building Blocks"
copy:
  hook: "Watch continents crack, drift, and collide in slow motion."
  short: "Follow a rift-to-ridge storyline that explains how tectonic plates forge our most dramatic landforms. From the East African Rift to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the towering Andes, see how mantle heat powers the surface you explore."
  depth:
    - "Annotated cross-sections illustrate divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries with real-world examples."
    - "Thermal plume diagrams show hotspots birthing shield volcano chains like Hawai‘i."
    - "Infographics connect tectonics to mineral resources, geothermal power, and earthquake preparedness."
