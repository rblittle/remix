    text: "I stand on the vaka before dawn, toes gripping the deck as the swell rolls under us. The stars fade one by one, so I switch to the feel of the wind curling around my cheek and the taste of salt in the air. My aunt taught me to read these signs; now I teach apprentices to set our double hull on course without instruments."

    location: "Pisac, Peru"
    text: "Before school I climb the terrace steps with my grandmother, cuy feed bag on my back. We press fingers into the soil to judge last night’s frost and adjust which potato rows we uncover. I log the temperature with a solar-powered sensor; later I’ll upload it for our community weather station."

    location: "Loita Hills, Kenya"
    text: "My cattle know the track to the salt lick, but I watch the clouds building over Nguruman. The grass sang dry last season, so our council mapped fresh rotation circles on cowhide.
