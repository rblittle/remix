  hook: "Meet the life zones that band our planet."
  short: "From equatorial rainforests to polar ice, every biome hosts distinct communities and caretakers. Track how temperature and rainfall shape biodiversity, and hear from stewards safeguarding seed banks, reefs, and cloud forests."
  depth:
    - "Biome wheel pairs climate graphs with flagship species and human knowledge keepers."
    - "Global map highlights biodiversity hotspots and Indigenous-managed territories."
    - "Callouts celebrate community-led restoration, from Sámi reindeer herders to Brazilian agroforestry cooperatives."
