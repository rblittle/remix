  depth:
    - "Animated map traces synchronized migrations with seasonal color cues and stopover icons."
    - "Profiles explain navigation tools: magnetic sensing, celestial cues, and memory of river scents."
    - "Community science panels highlight Indigenous observers, fishers, and satellite taggers collaborating to protect corridors."
