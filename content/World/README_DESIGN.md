# World Station Design Overview

## Layout Strategy
- Three-column grid with circular centerpiece anchoring introduction poster.
- Shared gutters: 1.5 in to allow consistent flow between interpretive panels.
- Use diagonal connectors for cross-referencing climate, biome, and cultural layers.

## Color & Typography
- Palette: deep indigo (#1F3B73) background, biome accent swatches matched to WCAG contrast.
- Type stack: Kaycliff Headline (display), Kaycliff Sans (body). Maintain 180 pt/72 pt/42 pt hierarchy.

## Accessibility
- Provide tactile relief overlays on key world landforms for touch engagement.
- Audio description QR codes at lower right of each poster.
- Ensure non-color icons for climate, culture, biodiversity categories.

## Fabrication Notes
- Print on matte anti-glare vinyl with magnetic map overlays for seasonal updates.
- Embed LED edge lighting for the centerpiece halo effect.
