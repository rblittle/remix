  hook: "Quick reads on the planet’s pulse."
  short: "Four featurettes reveal how Earth’s systems interconnect—from energy transitions to protected lands. Each mini-map or chart stays within the column to keep browsing fast and insightful."
  depth:
    - "Energy Shift": "Community-driven renewables are accelerating in diverse regions."
    - "Food Security": "Agroecology and trade routes feed billions through cooperation."
    - "Protected Planet": "Nations expand conservation while respecting Indigenous tenure."
    - "Urban Oceans": "Coastal cities manage blue carbon for resilience."
