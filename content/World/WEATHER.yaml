copy:
  hook: "Follow the winds that stitch the hemispheres together."
  short: "See how jet streams, monsoons, and trade winds orchestrate the planet’s daily forecast. The elevation strip compares a Himalaya-to-Pacific transect, showing how mountains redirect moisture. Learn when each pattern peaks and why it matters for travelers and wildlife."
  depth:
    - "Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar cells explain why trade winds blow steadily toward the equator while westerlies steer storms in mid-latitudes."
    - "Seasonal monsoon arrows emphasize the June–September South Asian wet surge and the December–March Australian counterpart."
    - "The timeline correlates El Niño–Southern Oscillation phases with coral bleaching alerts and crop yield shifts."
